==== The ways to representation of Graphs

1. Adjacency Matrix
* The adjacency matrix of a graph with `N` nodes is an `N x N` matix.
    
        [A  B  C]
    [A]  0  1  0
    [B]  1  0  0
    [C]  1  1  0
   
* The Number of `1` in the matrix is equals to number of `edges` in the graph.

* Adjacency matrix of a `Directed graph` is `asymmetric`
* Adjacency matrix of a `undirected graph` is `symmetric`
    ** (i, j ) = (j, i)




2. Adjacency List

Each vertex/note maintains a `linked list` of adjacent vertex

   Flaws::
    * In list order matters, thus same graph can have multiple representation
    * Deletion of node is inefficient
        ** Requires iteration through all adjacent node

3. Adjacency Sets

Every vertex maintains a set of adjacent nodes
