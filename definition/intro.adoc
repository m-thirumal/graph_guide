==== Directed Graph

Relationship goes one way.

Example::
    1. *Twitter->* Morty follows Rick 
    2. Thirumal drives *->* his car

==== Undirected Graph

Relationship goes both way

Example::
    1. Rick and Morty plays *<-->* game

==== Adjacent Nodes

A *Egdge* connects two *Vertex*.

==== Degree of a Node

    The degree of a Node = number of incident edges 

==== Paths

A series of edges links nodes `A` to `Z`.

===== Undirected cyclic Graph

===== Undirected Acyclic Graph

===== Directed cyclic Graph

===== Directed Acyclic Graph [DAGs]

==== Connected Graph

Every node is `connected` to every other node via series of edge

==== Disconnected Graph

==== Connected Graph with no Cycle

Tree::
    Tree are great for depicting hieraachical relationship

Forest::

    Set of disjoint Trees
